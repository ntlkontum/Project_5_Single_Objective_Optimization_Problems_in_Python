# Project 5: Solve Single Objective Optimization Problems in Python

**Single Objective Optimization Problems (SOOP)**: An optimization problem involves finding the best solution (maximum or minimum) for an objective function within a set of constraints. In manufacturing and supply chains, the results of optimization problems help optimize the supply chain, plan production and delivery schedules, and allocate resources

**Main types:**
- Linear Optimization (LP) – Both the objective function and constraints are linear.
- Nonlinear Optimization (NLP) – The objective function or constraints are nonlinear.
- Integer Optimization (IP) – Decision variables must be integers.
- Binary Integer Programming (BIP)- Decision variables: Binary (0 or 1 only)
- Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP)- Decision variables: Some integer, some continuous

In this project, I solve optimization problems using direct built-in functions in common optimization libraries like **PuLP**, **Gurobi** and **OR-Tools** and handle more complex optimization problems using Python programming.
